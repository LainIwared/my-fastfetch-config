# Was inspired by someone elses config: 
was inspired by a fastfetch config i saw on youtube wish i could rememeber the name to give him credit the only things i really changed was how the file 
projects the image when fastfetch is run and also my own custom location.

# This is my first commit:
this is my first ever commit to github i hope to add more in the future whether it be a dot file customization or an actual module or
applet.
