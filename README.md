# Was inspired by someone elses config: 
was inspired by a fastfetch config i saw on youtube wish i could rememeber the name to give him credit the only things i really changed was how the file 
projects the image when fastfetch is run and also my own custom location and my own custom message at the bottom instead of having just colours.

# This is my first commit:
this is my first ever commit to github i hope to add more in the future whether it be a dot file customization or an actual module or
applet.
